# Jigsaw-Toxic-Comment-Classification

## Project Overview
The Toxic Comment Classification project is an application that uses machine learning to identify toxic comments. The application uses a dataset of comments from social media platforms, such as Twitter, to train a model that can detect toxic comments. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify toxic comments and help moderators filter out comments that violate community guidelines.
